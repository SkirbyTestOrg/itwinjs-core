      "comment": "Always compute selection when syncing tool selection with logical selection - that's necessary to determine concrete element class names. Without that, we're adding keys with \"BisCore:Element\" class to selection and then our keys compare fails (presentation components like the table always have concrete class names). This can cause rows / nodes not to be highlighted in components.",
