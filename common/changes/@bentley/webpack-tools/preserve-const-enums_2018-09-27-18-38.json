      "comment": "Added ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin to speed up webpack builds and test runs.\n\nWhile this should greatly improve webpack performance, there are two side effects that may be considered breaking changes:\n  - The TypeScript type checking process will now rely soley on tsconfig files when resolving modules.  (See https: //www.npmjs.com/package/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin#modules-resolution).\n  - Type checking errors will now be reported concurrently with test result output.",
