/**
 * Orchestrator of a one-at-a-time Promise. This concept is useful only for *replaceable* operations (that is, operations where subsequent requests replace and obviate
 * the need for previous requests) over slow HTTP connections. In that case, without this class, the stream of requests can overwhelm the connection, and cause the HTTP
 * request queue to grow such that the delay to service new requests is unbounded.
 *
 * With this class, we issue the initial request immediately. When the second request arrives before the first one completes, it becomes *pending*. If subsequent
 * requests arrive with a pending request, the current pending request is *aborted* (its Promise is rejected) and the new request becomes pending.
 * When the active request completes, the pending request (if present) is started. In this manner there will only ever be one outstanding HTTP request for this type
 * of operation, but the last request will always eventually complete.
