## Description

The __@bentley/frontend-devtools__ package contains various tools and widgets designed to help track information and diagnose issues related to the iModel.js front-end display system. It is intended chiefly for use by developers.

Because this is a developer-only package, its functionality is not expected to ever be promoted from "beta" to "public".

## Contents

* /src/FrontendDevTools.ts - entry point for initializing the package.
* /src/ui/ - rudimentary basic html controls used to build the widgets.
* /src/tools/ - a collection of immediate-mode and interactive-mode tools. All of the tools' key-in strings begin with "fdt" (as in, "Front-end Dev Tools").
* /src/widgets/ - widgets that wrap some of the package's functionality into embeddable UI controls, including:
  * `KeyinField` - allows any tool to be executed by typing in its keyin string (with autocompletion).
  * `FpsTracker` - displays the average frames-per-second.
  * `TileStatisticsTracker` - displays the state of tile requests in the system.
  * `MemoryTracker` - displays statistics about GPU memory allocated by the display system.
  * `DiagnosticsPanel` - combines all of the above widgets into a single panel, along with some additional controls for toggling tile bounding volumes, displaying project extents, etc.

## Usage

The package must be initialized before use. This can be done when your application starts up, or deferred until first use of the package. The packages' tools will not be registered until the package is initialized.

Example of initializing at start-up:
```ts
  IModelApp.startup();
  await FrontendDevTools.initialize();
```

An easy way to use this package is to instantiate a `DiagnosticsPanel`, supplying a `Viewport` for which the panel will supply diagnostics and tools.
You can then integrate the panel into your UI by appending its `element` HTMLElement to your DOM.

Alternatively, you can embed any configuration of the widgets into your DOM as you like.

Even if you use none of the widgets, initializing the package will make all of its tools available for use, ready to be associated with your own UI entry points or to be executed via key-in. The set of available key-ins can be found in /public/locales/en/FrontendDevTools.json.
