## 1.2.0
Wed, 24 Jul 2019 11:47:26 GMT

### Updates

- added optional HTMLElement member to Marker

- Added limited opt-in support for drawing tiles from secondary IModelConnections and locating elements within them. Users must implement tools that can properly handle results like a HitDetail pointing to a different IModelConnection than the one associated with the viewport.
- Fix Viewport.addViewedModels() failing to update view if some models needed to be loaded asynchronously.
- Fix empty message body when display Bing map attribution info.
- Update beta PluginUiProvider interfaces.
