/**
 * Sprites are small raster images that are drawn "on top" of Viewports by a ViewDecoration.
 * Their purpose is to draw the user's attention to something of importance.
 * <p>
 * There are two classes in the Sprites subsystem: ISprite (a Sprite Definition) and SpriteLocation.
 * Sprite Definitions are the images that define the way a type of sprite looks and are generally
 * loaded one time and saved for the rest of a session. A SpriteLocation defines the current
 * position of a single Sprite in a Viewport.
 * <p>
 * A SpriteLocation can be either active or inactive. It becomes active by specifying a location
 * (an x,y point) and a Sprite Definition to draw at that point. It should be obvious that a single Sprite
 * Definition can be used many times by many Sprite Locations and that a single Sprite Location can
 * change both position and which Sprite Definition is shown at that position over time.
 * <p>
 * Sprites can be of varying sizes and color depths and can have both opaque and transparent pixels.
 * <p>
 * Element Manipulator handles and the AccuSnap indicators are examples of  use of Sprites.
 * @note It is also possible to draw a Sprite onto a Viewport directly
 * without ever using a SpritLocation. SpriteLocations are merely provided as a convenience.
