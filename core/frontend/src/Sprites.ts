/**
 * Sprites are small raster images that are drawn *on top* of Viewports by a ViewDecoration.
 * Their purpose is to draw the user's attention to something of importance.
 *
 * There are two classes in the Sprites subsystem: Sprite (a Sprite image) and SpriteLocation.
 * Sprite are the images that define the way a type of sprite looks and are generally
 * loaded one time and saved for the rest of a session. A SpriteLocation defines the current
 * position of a single Sprite in a Viewport.
 *
 * A SpriteLocation can be either active or inactive. It becomes active by specifying a location
 * (an x,y point) and a Sprite to draw at that point. A Sprite
 * can be used many times by many SpriteLocations and a single SpriteLocation can
 * change both position and which Sprite is shown at that position over time.
