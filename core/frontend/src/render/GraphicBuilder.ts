 *
 * The typical process for constructing a [[RenderGraphic]] proceeds as follows:
 *  1. Use [[RenderContext.createGraphicBuilder]] to obtain a builder.
 *  2. Set up the symbology using [[GraphicBuilder.activateGraphicParams]].
 *  3. Add one or more geometric primitives using methods like [[GraphicBuilder.addShape]] and [[GraphicBuilder.addLineString]], possibly setting new symbology in between.
 *  4. Use [[GraphicBuilder.finish]] to produce the finished [[RenderGraphic]].
 *
 * @note Most of the methods which add geometry to the builder take ownership of their inputs rather than cloning them.
 * So, for example, if you pass an array of points to addLineString(), you should not subsequently modify that array.
