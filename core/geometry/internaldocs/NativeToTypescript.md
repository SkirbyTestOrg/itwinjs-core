# imodeljs native versus typescript geometry types

## Typescript directory geometry/src/geometry3d
| Concept  | Native | Native Remarks | Typescript | Typescript Remarks |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| Point | DPoint3d <br> DPoint2d | |Point3d <br> Point2d | Point, vector share `XYZ` base calss |
| Vector | DVec3d <br> DVec2d| "Vector derives from Point" <br> for legacy C reasons |Vector3d <Vector2d> ||
| 3x3 matrix | RotMatrix | 3x3 indexed [i][j] | Matrix3d | 3x3 packed as coffs[] in row-major order <br> inverse coffs cached |
| Affine transform | Transform | 3x3 indexed [i][j] | Transform | `origin` and `matrix` are separate members. |
| Range | DRange3d <br> DRange2d <br> DRange1d |  | Range3d <br> Range2d <br> Range1d> |  |
| Ray | DRay3d | | Ray3d | |
| Plane by origin and normal | DPlane3d | | Plane3dByOriginAndUnitNormal | unit normal enforced by create methods |
| Plane by origin and 2 vectors in plane | DPoint3dDVec3dDVec3d | | Plane3dByOriginAndVectors | |

### CurvePrimitive

A curve primitive is a curve parameterized with fraction 0 at start, fraction 1 at end.

| Concept  | Native | Native Remarks | Typescript | Typescript Remarks |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| virtual primitive | ICurvePrimitive | | CurvePrimitive | |
| Line segment  | CURVE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_Line <br> DSegment3d | | LineSegment3d | |
| Linestring  | CURVE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_LineString <br> bvector<DPoint3d> | | LineString3d | |
| elliptic arc | CURVE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_Arc <br> DEllipse3d | | Arc3d | |
| bspline curve | CURVE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_BsplineCurve <br> MSBSplineCurve | BSplineCurve | |
| bezier curve | (Note 1) | | BezierCurve | |
| curve with distance index | (Note 2) | | CurveChainWithDistanceIndex | |

* Note 1: In native code, hide a bezier curve as a bspline curve with control point count equal to order.
* Note 2: In native code, a CurveVectorWithDistanceIndex has queries for "distance along multi-primitive curve" but is not a first-class curve primitive.

### CurveCollection

| Concept  | Native | Native Remarks | Typescript | Typescript Remarks |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| virtual collection | CurveVector | "boundary type" code distinguishes subtypes | CurveCollection | Derived classes distinguish subtypes |
| open path | BOUNDARY_TYPE_Open | | Path | |
| closed path | BOUNDARY_TYPE_Outer <br> BOUNDARY_TYPE_Inner | Never trust Outer vs Inner labels | Loop | |
| multi-loop parity region | BOUNDARY_TYPE_ParityRegion | DgnPlatform expects first child _Outer, others _Inner | ParityRegion | All children must be `Loop` |
| multiple regions | BOUNDARY_TYPE_UnionRegion | | UnionRegion ||
| unstructured | BOUNDARY_TYPE_None | | BagOfCurves | |
