# Appendix B BIO – Theoretical Basis of BIS

Need to ensure this section doesn’t get too big….

Limit to 3-4 pages.

## Introduction

Why Bother with a Theoretical Basis?

## The Nature of Information

What is “pure information”2 in the real world? We know it exists, but we can’t touch it.

For information to exist, it must be encoded into some physical media (e.g. a magnetic media). The encoding of the information into the media (e.g. the arrangement of the magnetic particles such that they carry the information) is known as a “carrier”4 of the information.

Let’s consider the example of a “poem”. It is “pure information”. There is only one instance of the poem “Jabberwocky” (by Lewis Caroll) in the universe. However, the existence of that information (the poem) depends on the physical world. That poem has to be “carried” by at least one instance of physical media, or else it will cease to exist. A human brain can be the “media” for a poem, with the arrangement of matter in the brain somehow “carrying” the poem. When I write down the poem, the arrangement of the ink on the paper somehow carries the poem. If there were only a blob of ink on the paper, it would not be carrying the poem.

Practically speaking, we tend to assign identifiers or names to the “pure information”, but (practically speaking) we mostly work with “carriers” of that information. We could separately identify individual “carriers” of information, e.g. the “merchant copy” of my credit card receipt information and the “customer copy”… and all of those carriers are encoded in some media.

As evidenced by the “merchant copy” example, the “carrier” is often colloquially referred to as a “copy” of the information, which is technically incorrect because the pure information is non-physical, and only one “instance” of it exists in the universe, so the “pure information” cannot truly be copied. When you “make a copy of” the poem “Jabborwocky” you don’t end up with two different poems named “Jabborwocky”, you end up with yet-another-carrier-of the one-and-only “Jabborwocky” poem. What is actually being copied is the encoding that “carries” the information in some media.


## BFO

Widely used “realist” foundational ontology

Discuss major concepts (like Role, “realist ontology”)

## BIO 

BIO describes the real world

Discuss major concepts added (like Model)

## From BIO to BIS

BIS is based on BIO, but we can bend reality in our real world:

- Roles can exist without PhysicalElement

- Etc.
