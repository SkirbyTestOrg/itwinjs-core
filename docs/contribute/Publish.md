# Publishing Changes

New version of the library should be published when it reaches some
milestone. When it does, the following steps should be taken to publish
new package versions:

1. `rush publish -a`

   The command does several things:
   - Generates changelogs based on change files (generated by `rush change`).
   - Increases library package versions. The new versions depend on the
   answers to `rush change` questions.
   - Updates library package dependency versions.

2. Review the changes made by Rush and make appropriate changes, if necessary.
*CHANGELOG.md* files can be regenerated after changing *CHANGELOG.json* with a
rush command `rush publish --regenerate-changelogs`.

3. `git add .`

4. `git commit -m "Applying package updates."`

5. `git push`

6. The `ecpresentation` CI job is automatically started. A successful CI build can
be released following one the below ways:
   - Open the job and tag it with a "Release" tag. This will start a release job
   after a successful build.
   - After the build is complete go to it's VSTS site and press "Release".
