# 0.183.0 Change Notes

## New signature for RpcInterface.forward

To support stricter type checking of apply, call, and bind usage in upcoming versions of the typescript compiler, the signature of RpcInterface.forward is now (parameters: IArguments). This is not a breaking change for most use cases within RPC interfaces that invoke forward via apply. However, it is now possible and preferable with the new signature to directly invoke this.foward(arguments) in RPC interfaces instead of using apply.

## Node 10

The iModel.js backend now requires [Node version 10](https://nodejs.org) or later. If you run the backend, please install it before running this version.

If you build the iModel.js packages from the monorepo, you should follow these steps:

1) `rush clean`
1) `rush unlink`
1) uninstall current version of Node (on Windows, via "add or remove programs")
1) install latest version of Node 10
1) `npm install -g @microsoft/rush`
1) `git pull`
1) `rush install`
   - if you get an error about npm versions, do `npm uninstall -g npm`
1) `rush build`
1) `rush test`
