## Update to TypeScript 3.5

For the 1.0 release, iModel.js was using TypeScript 3.2. In order to take advantage of recent improvements, iModel.js has moved up to TypeScript 3.5. One of the main features of interest was the incremental build support. TypeScript 3.5 also includes some enhanced error checking over what was available in 3.2. This makes it easier to identify potential problems, but also may mean that source code that successfully compiled using 3.2 may require minor adjustments to compile using 3.5.

Please see the [TypeScript Roadmap](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Roadmap) for more details.
