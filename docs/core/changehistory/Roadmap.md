# The iModel.js Roadmap

This roadmap provides the *big picture* view of the development path for the iModel.js platform, and the relative priorities along the path.

## Themes

We will use the following themes (that may be adjusted from time-to-time according to your input) to drive the evolution of iModel.js:

- Assume that every Digital Twin will be a heterogeneous amalgamation of data from many sources. iModel.js should be the library for bringing them together as seamlessly as possible.
- Empower developers to create immersive experiences for Infrastructure Digital Twins.
- Empower developers to create powerful Agents that react to changes to iModels as they are checked into the iModelHub.
- Create a delightful developer experience through:
  - broad support for popular hardware and operating environments
  - thorough and accurate documentation
  - helpful samples and tutorials
  - quick turnaround on issues
  - adherence to open source standards and norms where possible
- Create a welcoming and inclusive ecosystem of innovation and enterprise.
- Deliver new features, making them opt-in where possible.
- Be as un-opinionated as possible by avoiding unnecessary dependencies
- Remain focused on performance, scalability, security and extensibility.
