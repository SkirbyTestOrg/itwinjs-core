        "Infrastructure assets are complex, valuable, and long-lived, yet ever-changing. The businesses and governments that design, build, own and operate them wish to create 'Digital Twins' that accurately reflects those traits. No single software system can possibly meet all of those requirements at once. Rather, the business of infrastructure requires software that is both flexible and open so that it can be used wherever needed and easily integrated with other systems wherever necessary. That is the design goal of the iModel.js project. It is built to be as malleable as possible to satisfy your business requirements within your existing business systems. We strive to be both open and transparent, while also stable and secure. iModel.js is at the heart of Bentley's business mission. It is our passion and vocation - it's not a community project by part time volunteers with other jobs."

        content:
"We know that when you use a set of libraries like iModel.js, you're <i>not</i> expecting to 'become an iModel.js developer'. Rather, you wish to incorporate code and data from many sources, joining it into a unified system and user experience. For this reason, iModel.js layers atop the most popular and most standard cloud and web technologies. It starts with <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org\">TypeScript</a> - in our opinion the most productive and compelling programming ecosystem anywhere, ever. It builds on <a href=\"https://www.sqlite.org\">SQLite</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript\">JavaScript</a>, <a href=\"https://nodejs.org\">Node.js</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com\">NPM</a>, <a href=\"https://electronjs.org\">Electron</a>, <a href=\"https://www.docker.com\">Docker</a>, <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io\">Kubernetes</a> and many other open source leaders, in addition to standards like HTML, CSS, and WebGL. The stack is intentionally chosen to be as mainstream and un-opinionated as possible to reduce input impedance with your codebase, and to preserve your flexibility over time."

    {
        header: "Open, For Innovation",
        content:
"Sometimes pushing the envelope in pursuit of new ideas means breaking new ground in terms of hardware, software, or system design. A primary reason for open-sourcing the iModel.js library is to permit its use in scenarios outside of those for which it was originally conceived. We know firsthand that simply examining the inner workings of a codebase can vastly improve your understanding of its design and limitations. Source level debugging and even local modification can substantially improve programmer productivity when push comes to shove. And of course the ability to fix/change the source when necessary means self-help is always available if needed. "

    {
        header: "Open for suggestions",
        content:
"We think iModel.js is built on a solid foundation of Bentley's experience creating infrastructure software over 35 years. But we recognize that the opportunities for leveraging the hidden value of Infrastructure Digital Twins are so vast and so diverse, that its likely that some use cases will stress edge conditions in the iModel.js stack. You may find problems, have suggestions for enhancements or improvements, or have new ideas that will benefit the iModel.js community. In those cases, please don't be shy about telling us - either with Issue reports, discussion posts, or even Pull Requests. "
