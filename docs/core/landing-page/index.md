middleContent: "Infrastructure assets are complex, valuable, and long-lived, yet ever-changing. The businesses and governments that design, build, own and operate them wish to create 'Digital Twins' that accurately reflects those traits. It is obvious that no single software system can possibly meet all of those requirements at once. Rather, the businesses of infrastructure require software layers that are both flexible and open so that it can be used wherever needed and easily integrated with other systems wherever necessary. That is the design goal of iModelJs. It is built to be both open and transparent, while also stable and secure.
<p>
Open, By Design
iModelJs layers atop the most popular and standard cloud and web technologies. It starts with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), in our opinion the most productive and compelling programming ecosystem anywhere, ever. It builds on [SQLite], [JavaScript], [Node.js], [NPM], [Electron], [Docker], [Kubernetes] and many other open source leaders, in addition to standards like HTML, CSS, and WebGL. The stack is intentionally chosen to be as mainstream and open as possible to reduce input impedance with your codebase and to preserve your flexibility over time.
<p>
Open, For Innovation
We know that when you use a library like iModelJs, you're likely not interested in 'becoming an iModelJs developer'. Rather, you wish to incorporate code and data from many sources, joining it into a unified system and user experience. We strive that iModels and iModelJs won't be the weak link in that chain.
<p>
Open for Suggestions
The opportunities for leveraging the hidden value of Digital Twins are so vast and so diverse, that its likely that many use cases will stress edge conditions in the iModelJs stack. In that cases, we expect that you may have suggestions for enhancements, improvements or even new ideas to benefit the iModelJs community. Please don't be shy about telling us how things can be improved - either with Issue reports, discussion posts, or even Pull Requests.
