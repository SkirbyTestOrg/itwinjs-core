# Accessing Elements in an IModelDb

An iModel.js [Element]($backend) is an in-memory representation of a [BIS Element](../../bis/intro/element-fundamentals.md). An Element object provides easy access to a set of properties and [Aspects](../Glossary.md#elementaspect).

[IModelDb.elements]($backend) represents the collection of Elements in an iModel.

Every iModel contains a single "root" element that is the parent of all partitions. It is accessed by a special function:

*Example:*
``` ts
[[include:Elements.getRootSubject]]
```

You can look up all other elements in various ways. As described in BIS Element Fundamentals, an element is identified by a unique ID and may also have a Code and/or a FederationGuid. If you know one of these identifiers, you can look up an element very efficiently. The [IModelDb.Elements.getElement]($backend) method makes that easy.

*Example:*
``` ts
[[include:Elements.getElement]]
```

You can discover an element's ID by [using ECSQL](./ExecutingECSQL.md) to query other properties or even using [spatial queries](../SpatialQueries.md)
