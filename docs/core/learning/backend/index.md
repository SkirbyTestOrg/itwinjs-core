# Backend Code

Backend code is concerned mainly with data access, as described in the [app architecture overview](../../learning/SoftwareArchitecture.md). A backend may be in the form of a [service or agent](../../learning/App.md#agents-and-services) or an [app-specific backend](../../learning/App.md#app-backend).

Backend code:

* runs on a computer with a copy of an iModel
* has access to the local file system
* determines the JavaScript engine (vs. the frontend where the JavaScript engine comes from the user's browser).
* has direct access to the native library, and hence its methods are generally synchronous.
* may load third-party native code

The iModelJs backend library is delivered in the **npm package** `@bentley/imodeljs-backend`.

App backends, services, and agents must depend on @bentley/imodeljs-backend.
