# The Backend Library

The Backend refers to the layers of the iModelJs library that run on a computer with a copy of an iModel. The backend always runs in-process (i.e. in the same address space) with the native layers. The backend may be in the form of a [service or agent](../../overview/App.md#agents-and-services) or an [app-specific backend](../../overview/App.md#app-backend).

The backend:

* has direct access to the native library, and hence its methods are generally synchronous.
* has access to the local file system
* determines the JavaScript engine (vs. the frontend where the JavaScript engine comes from the user's browser). Usually that is V8 from Node.js
* may load third-party native code

See [the app architecture overview](../../overview/App.md) for more on how backends fit into overall app architecture.

All Promise-returning backend methods must [manage the LoggingActivityContext](./ManagingLoggingActivityContext.md).

The backend library is delivered in the **npm package** `@bentley/imodeljs-backend`.
