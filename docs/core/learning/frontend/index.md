# The App Frontend

The frontend of an app refers to the layers of software that are concerned mainly with data display and user interaction, as described in the [app architecture overview](../../overview/SoftwareArchitecture.md).

The frontend *always* runs inside a web browser.

* When used as a Web app, it can run in any modern web browser. See compatibility list. It communicates with a backend and/or other services via HTTP.
* When part of a desktop app, it runs inside the Electron frontend process in Chrome.
* When part of a mobile app, it runs inside the Safari built-in browser on iOS and the Chrome browser for Android.

An app always implements its own frontend script and resources. The app's frontend script must depend on @bentley/imodeljs-frontend.

The iModelJs frontend library is delivered in the **npm package** `@bentley/imodeljs-frontend`
