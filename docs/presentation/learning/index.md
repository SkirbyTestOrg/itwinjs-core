# iModel.js Presentation Library

iModel.js Presentation library helps retrieve presentation data from iModels and
takes care of unified selection. What data to retrieve from an iModel is
defined by consumers in a declarative way, using presentation rules - that's
why the library is commonly called "presentation rules engine".
