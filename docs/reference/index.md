# iModelJs Reference Documentation

This section gives detailed documentation on the packages and classes in iModelJs. Each package is organized in to a series of topics that form a
logical outline of its concepts.

Generally, it is not expected that the Reference documentation will be read sequentially or entirely. Rather, it
is consulted to explain details of the APIs. It elaborates on topics introduced in the Learning and Overview sections. Start there to get a
better understanding of the *big picture* concepts upon which the API is based.

The iModelJs library is organized into the following separately downloadable [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages under the `@bentley` scope:

- ($frontend)

- ($backend)

- ($common)

- ($geometry)

- ($clients)

- ($bentley)
