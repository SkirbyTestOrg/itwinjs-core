  iModel.js UI - React components and TypeScript library for building iModelJs application user interfaces
</h1>

# Getting Started with iModel.js UI

## Introduction

iModel.js UI is a set of [React](https://www.reactjs.org) components and a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) library for building [iModelJs](https://imodeljs.github.io/iModelJs-docs-output) application user interfaces.

## iModel.js Core

iModel.js UI is built to provide user interfaces for iModel.js apps. If you are not familiar with the core functionality, you can find its documentation here:
[iModel.js Getting Started](https://imodeljs.github.io/iModelJs-docs-output/getting-started/)

## Required Tools

In addition to the tools required by iModel.js Core, iModel.js UI uses the following:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  - Our UI controls are built using the React JavaScript library
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
  - We use Redux for state management

## Suggested Tools

  These tools are very helpful when working with React UI controls, including those in iModel.js UI

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - Excellent support for TypeScript and React controls.
- [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
  - Great support for the virtual DOM as well as viewing and changing component props.
- [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd)
  - Allows for runtime control of an application's state and time travel for debugging.
