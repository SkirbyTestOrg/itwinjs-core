# Why React?

React is a fast and lightweight library for user interface development. The fact that it is a library rather than a framework makes it a better choice than more opinionated frameworks for developing a platform of reusable UI components. Other considerations include:

**Popularity** React topped StackOverflow’s “most loved framework” in their [2017 developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-frameworks-libraries-and-other-technologies
) and was “most wanted” in their [2018 survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-frameworks-libraries-and-tools). It also has the most five-star ratings and weekly downloads in NPM.

**Flexibility** React can be easily embedded into other applications thanks to the flexibility of ReactDOM.render(). Although React is commonly used at startup to load a single root React component into the DOM, ReactDOM.render() can also be called multiple times for independent parts of the UI which can be as small as a button, or as large as an app. In fact, this is exactly how React is used at Facebook. This lets them write applications in React piece by piece and combine them with existing server-generated templates and other client-side code.(link to Angular sample on github)

**Tooling** (some stuff about tooling)
