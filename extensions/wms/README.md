An iModel.js example Extension that demonstrates adding a WMS (Web Map Service) tiled graphics provider to the graphics of a view:

This extension serves as an example of a extension that can be added to iModel.js host applications.
See http://imodeljs.org for comprehensive documentation on the iModel.js API and the various constructs used in this sample.

## Development Setup

1. Select and prepare an iModel.js host application. You can use the [Simple Viewer App](https://github.com/imodeljs/imodeljs-samples/tree/master/interactive-app/simple-viewer-app), for example.

2. The dependencies are installed as part of "rush install" in the iModel.js repository.

3. Build the extension as part of the "rush build" in the iModel.js repository, or separately build using the npm build command.

  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```

4. Copy all the output files in the lib/build directory tree to imjs_extensions/iotDemo directory in the web resources of the host application.

5. Start the host application - go to its directory and run:

  ```sh
  npm run start:servers
  ```

6. Open a web browser (e.g., Chrome or Edge), and browse to localhost:3000.

7. Start the extension using the ExtensionTool - ExtensionTool.run("localhost:3000/wmsExtension");
